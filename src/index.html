          PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW)
          ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE

        <p class="text-justify">
          Effective date: 8th May 2017
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The general BatukTheDog Privacy Policy applies to content provided by, and your
          use of, BatukTheDog Facebook Applications (the "Apps").
          In this policy, “us”, “we” or “our” means BatukTheDog.
          We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including to
          take account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our
          operations. All personal information held by us will be governed by the
          most recently updated policy. This policy was last updated in May 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          As a registered Facebook user, you are also subject to Facebook's privacy
          policy. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">
          http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
        </p>

        <h1>Collecting information about you</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We will collect and use individual user details only where we have legitimate
          business reasons and are legally entitled to do so, for example: BatukTheDog App.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The information about you that we may collect via the BatukTheDog App includes your
          basic Facebook account information – that is, name, email, profile picture,
          birth date, gender, networks, user ID and any other information you choose to
          share according to your Facebook account settings information about your use
          of the App.
        </p>
        <h1>How we use information about you</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We collect and use information about App users for five main reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>To operate the Apps.</li>
          <li>To personalize the content of the Apps for individual users.</li>
          <li>To help us to monitor and improve the Apps.</li>
          <li>Where appropriate, to advertise on the Apps.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We may, however, email you occasionally with information or queries about the
          Apps, for example, to offer rewards to users.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We will not transfer any personal information we receive from you via the Apps
          to any third parties outside BatukTheDog app and www.itsBatukTheDog.me.
        </p>
        <h1>Removing an App and deleting data</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">

          account settings – <a href="http://www.facebook.com/setttings?tab=applications">
          http://www.facebook.com/setttings?tab=applications</a>.
          Once you remove the BatukTheDog App, we no longer have permission to access your Facebook
          information and your data will be removed from the BatukTheDog App.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Once you remove an App we no longer have permission to access your Facebook
          information. However, we may retain that data and continue to use it for the
          purposes described above until you tell us that you withdraw your consent to use
          those data.
        </p>

        <h1>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">
          This Privacy Policy is effective as of (add date) and will remain in effect
          except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which
          will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

        <p class="text-justify">
          We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and
          you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the
          Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page
